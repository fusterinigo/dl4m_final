# Satellite Project

We are using methods learned from Deep Learning for Media (MPATE-GE 2039) to investigate how to generate and classify satellite imagery.

We had several research questions, including:

- What data sets exist for satellite imagery and how do they compare?
- How do different models perform on satellite imagery?
- Is RGB or Multispectral Band imagery better for deep learning?
- Can population be predicted from satellite imagery?

## Data

### EuroSAT

[The EuroSAT dataset](https://github.com/phelber/EuroSAT) provides two sets of 27,000 satellite images, one with 13 multispectral bands and another with RGB. This imagery has ten labels for land cover classification including 'AnnualCrop', 'Forest', and 'Highway'.

### Mapbox API

Using the Mapbox API, we generate two datasets of ~5400 images each, one for each census tract in the state of New York. They are set to two different "zoom" levels at the centroid of each census tract. The functions we used to call the API are contained in [generate_images.ipynb](https://github.com/DeanIA/dl4m_final/blob/main/generate_images.ipynb).

There datasets are quite large but can be accessed on a Shared Google Drive here. You may need to request access to open. Link: [Mapbox Datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14b-4faQ0EOhJEAhjNNlAyK46_-BIunRg).

### US Census Data

The US Census publishes data at the Census Tract level for all census tracts in the US. We utilized the informatino for the state of New York, uploaded here as tract_data.csv. The data was further manipulated using scripts written in R to calculate centroids and identify appropriate population density clusters for the different census tracts, contained in [census_tract_labels.R](https://github.com/DeanIA/dl4m_final/blob/main/census_tract_labels.R).

## Modeling

### Synthetic Data Generation with EuroSAT

Using the EuroSAT database we trained a VAE to generate synthetic satellite imagery. Due to the dataset's size and the varied nature of the imagery the model generated synthetic data too blurry to be used for further research. However, with a bigger dataset this approach seems promising.

### RBG vs Spectral Modeling

Using VGG-16 and BigEarthNet pretrained models to test land classification accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset's RGB and Multispectral imagery. The result suggests a model trained on multispectral imagery performs better for land classification tasks.  

### Population Density Prediction

Using the Mapbox dataset created from generate_images.ipynb, we built a CNN that was used to predict the urbanicty (rural, suburban, or urban) of the images across New York. The CNN resulted in validation accuracy of .92. This modeling is contained in [mapbox_rgb_model.ipynb](https://github.com/DeanIA/dl4m_final/blob/main/mapbox_rgb_model.ipynb).

Nathan researched satellite imagery datasets, trained the EuroSAT VAE model, helped design the final presentation, and took meeting notes. Dean developed models for RGB and spectral imaging using the EuroSAT dataset. Chris developed the Mapbox API functions, US census data analysis, and built the CNN to predict population density classes from NY State images. Iñigo took notes and offered alternatives for models and overall project ideas, also helped develop design the final presentation.
